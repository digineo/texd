texd is a TeXaS (TeX as (a) service) solution, designed for your internal document generation, i.e.
on your own servers.

It features:

- ad-hoc compilation,
- a simple HTTP API access,
- pluggable TeX distributions,
- ...

The idea behind texd is to provide a single, network-reachable compiler; sending a `.tex` file via
HTTP POST should then simply generate a PDF document. You won't need a TeX distribution on the
client system, just an HTTP client.

Several technologies make scaling in any dimension relatively easy:

- the TeX distribution is provided through Docker containers (this also allows using multiple
  distributions simultaneously)
- using HTTP enables redundancy and/or load balancing without much effort

## Documentation

The [latest documentation](./docs/index.md) can be found on GitHub.
