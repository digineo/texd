# History

texd came to life because I've build dozens of Rails applications, which all needed to build PDF
documents in one form or another (from recipies, to invoices, order confirmations, reports and
technical documentation). Each server basically needed a local TeX installation (weighing in at
several 100 MB, up to several GB). Compiling many LaTeX documents also became a bottleneck for
applications running on otherwise modest hardware (or cloud VMs), as this process is also
computationally expensive.

Over time I've considered using alternatives for PDF generation (Prawn, HexaPDF, gofpdf, SILE, iText
PDF, to name but a few), and found that the quality of the rendered PDF is far inferior to the ones
generated by LaTeX. Other times, the licensing costs are  astronomical, or the library doesn't
support some layouting feature, or the library in an early alpha stage or already abandoned...

I'll admit that writing TeX templates for commercial settings is a special kind of pain-inducing
form of art. But looking back at using LaTeX for now over a decade, I still feel it's worth it.
