# This Dockerfile is used by GitHub Actions to build the
# digineode/texd:latest image whenever there is a commit pushed
# to the master branch. For tagged commits, this also creates
# digineode/texd:vX and digineode/texd:vX.Y.Z.
#
# It leverages buildkit to generate an AMD64 and ARM64 image.
#
# For details, see workflows/test.yml, steps latest and release.
